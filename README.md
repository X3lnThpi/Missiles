- The game includes a Plane with different Missiles.
- Missiles have been designed using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.
- MVC pattern provides a clear separation between the model, view, and controller.
- Score update functionality has been implemented using the Observer pattern.
- Observer pattern allows objects to be notified of changes in another object.
- Command pattern is used to switch between touch and Gyro control.
- Command pattern encapsulates requests or actions as objects.
- Object Pooling technique has been implemented to store missiles.
- Object Pooling allows reusing pre-allocated objects rather than creating and destroying them.
- Reduces overhead of object creation and destruction, resulting in improved performance and smoother gameplay.
- Utilizing these design patterns has created a well-structured and efficient game.
- Game is easy to extend and maintain.
